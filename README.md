# An introduction to Autonomous Vehicles

The basics of autonomous vehicles 

EXECUTING THE DRIVE.PY CODE
1) Create a new folder and add the drive.py file
2) Add the model (.h5 file) created in Behavourial Cloning code
3) Do any minor changes according to the file names you created and execute the code.
4) Turn the UDACITY simulator on.
5) Switch to autonomous mode, you car will start self-driving immediately.

In order to use the drive.py program that will connect to the simulator please create a new conda environment and install the following packages:

CREATE A CONDA ENVIRONMENT:
1) conda create --name <any_name> python=3.6

PACKAGES TO BE INSTALLED:
1) conda install -c conda-forge flask
2) conda install -c conda forge python-socketio
3) conda install -c conda-forge eventlet
4) conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
5) conda install -c conda-forge keras
6) conda install -c conda-forge opencv
7) conda install -c anaconda pillow



## under construction
## All files needed to run the simulation are here, soon instructions on how to use them
